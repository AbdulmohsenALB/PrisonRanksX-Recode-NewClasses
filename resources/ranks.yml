# <!> Notes <!>:
# - First rank (A) cost should be 0 because it's the rank that you will get once you join the server! Changing the cost to anything else, would be pointless, as no money will be taken from the player.
# - The commands and the other actions that will be executed once you rankup, is the ones that are in the next rank, so for example, if you're at rank (A) and you perform "/rankup", the commands of rank B will be performed on you i.e "warp B" and not the ones in your current rank (the rank that you rankup from).
# - If you put any actions under the first rank (A), they will be performed when the player joins for the first time (when their PrisonRanksX data gets registered).
# - Last Rank next-rank should be set to: "LASTRANK", which indicates that there are no more ranks, NOT that the next rank is named LASTRANK.
